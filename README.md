> Simple service to receive callbacks. Useful for when testing APIs locally that send callbacks

## ü¶ø Prerequisites

- Java 17 or above

## üõ† Installation

1. Download latest sources and run:
 
 ```shell script
./gradlew build run
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

Once up and running you can set the callback url of the API you are testing to the callback endpoint of `callback-logger` - 
`http://localhost:7070/callback-logger/api/callback`.  You can send a callback manually using the following `curl` 
request:

```shell
curl -X POST --location "http://localhost:7070/callback-logger/api/callback" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

`callback-logger` provides a simple web interface to allow you to see the callbacks you have received.  You can access
the web interface by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:7070/callback-logger`:
